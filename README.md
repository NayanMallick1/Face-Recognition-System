## Description
A high-accuracy **Face Recognition System** using multi-algorithm detection (MTCNN, RetinaFace, Haar Cascade) with DeepFace's ArcFace embeddings. This system provides robust face validation, real-time webcam recognition, and automated attendance tracking with Excel reporting.

Key capabilities:
- üéØ Face detection with automatic algorithm selection
- üìä Attendance management with time-based deduplication
- üîç Incremental training for new faces
- üñºÔ∏è Image, video, and webcam input support
- üìÅ Automatic logging and reporting

---

## Features
- **Triple Detection System**: MTCNN, RetinaFace, and Haar Cascade with automatic fallback
- **Advanced Validation**: Aspect ratio, skin tone, texture, and symmetry checks
- **Real-time Recognition**: Webcam processing with frame optimization
- **Attendance Tracking**: Automatic Excel reports with timestamps
- **Incremental Learning**: Add new faces without full retraining
- **Multi-source Input**: Process images, videos, and live camera feeds
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Configurable time-based attendance filtering

### Configuration
Adjust parameters in `face_recognition_main.py:`
```bash
# Detection thresholds (Line 84)
if face['confidence'] > 0.01  # MTCNN confidence

# Validation parameters (validate_face function)
aspect_ratio = (0.6, 1.6)    # Line 35
min_face_size = 30            # Line 38
texture_threshold = 15        # Line 48
skin_ratio_threshold = 0.15   # Line 57

# Recognition threshold (Line 119)
if max_score > 0.65           # Similarity threshold

# Attendance interval (Line 157)
if time_diff.total_seconds() < 1800  # 30 minutes
```

### Troubleshooting
```bash
| Issue                        | Solution                                            |
|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| "Face embeddings file not found" | Run `train_face_recognizer.py` first            |
| High CPU usage               | Increase modulo in webcam loop (Line 269)           |
| Webcam not detected          | Try different camera indices (Line 250)             |
| Poor low-light detection     | Adjust HSV ranges in `validate_face()`              |
| False positives              | Increase similarity threshold (Line 119)            |
```
